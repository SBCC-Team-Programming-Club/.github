# 👾 SBCC Team Programming Club

> Building developers who can think, collaborate, and ship — together.

## 🧠 What We Do

We compete in **ICPC** every fall, but we believe great developers are built year-round.
During the spring off-season, we focus on what matters most — learning how to work as a team.

Real-world development is rarely solo. We use the off-season to practice the skills that
actually get you hired and make you a better teammate:

- Collaborating on shared codebases with Git & GitHub
- Breaking down problems and delegating work
- Code reviews, pair programming, and async communication
- Building projects from idea to deployment as a team

## 📅 Seasons at a Glance

| Season | Focus |
